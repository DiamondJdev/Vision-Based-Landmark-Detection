# Vision-Based Landmark Detection

Vision-Based Landmark Detection is a Python project focused on detecting helipads and vertiports from visual input. The core goal is to enable reliable, real-time recognition of landing sites using computer vision techniques. This repository is ideal for researchers, drone developers, and anyone interested in autonomous landing systems.

## Features

- **Helipad and Vertiport Detection:** Identifies and locates landing markers in images and video streams.
- **Vision-Based Algorithms:** Utilizes computer vision for robust performance in varying environments.
- **Python Implementation:** Easy to use and extend, leveraging popular Python libraries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DiamondJdev/Vision-Based-Landmark-Detection.git
   cd Vision-Based-Landmark-Detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

To run landmark detection on an image:
```bash
python detect_landmarks.py --input path/to/image.jpg
```

To process a video:
```bash
python detect_landmarks.py --input path/to/video.mp4
```
